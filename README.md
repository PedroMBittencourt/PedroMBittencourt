Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Pedro Bittencourt and I'm currently learning to code and studying System Analysis.

Currently I'm focusing in web development and improving my JavaScript and Front End Libraries knowledge working with React, Bootstrap and CSS.

I've also done some projects in Python and Java and I love learning about Linux as well.
