Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Pedro Bittencourt and I'm a backend developer and System Analysis student.

Currently I'm focusing in web development and practicing Back End development with NodeJS and TypeScript. 
On my most recent professional project, we're devoloping a management system using NestJs as the backend framework and MongoDB database.

I have studied Front End Development technologies, such as React, Bootstrap and Tailwind.

I've also done some projects in Python and Java and I love learning about Linux as well and working within the terminal.
