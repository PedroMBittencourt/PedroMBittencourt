Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Pedro Bittencourt and I'm currently learning to code and studying System Analysis.

Currently I'm focusing in web development and practicing backend development with NodeJS and the Express.js package. 
I have studied Front End Development technologies, such as React, Bootstrap and CSS.

I've also done some projects in Python and Java and I love learning about Linux as well.
